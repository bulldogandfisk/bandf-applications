# React - extended

A reasonably comprehensive starter kit for `React` applications, including demonstrations of how to set up a `Router`, `i18n`, `MaterialUI` interfaces, themes, forms, state management, and more.

Additionally, an example of using `bandf` `Services` to send mail, implementing a login system with emailed verification codes.
